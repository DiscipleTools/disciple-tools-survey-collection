![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24901539/230605327-5de47a16-e1bb-45a5-bacf-c2e3195862cd.png)

Collect **Lead Metrics**: Shares, Prayers, Invitations...
Lead metrics are the things we CAN do.  

Collect **Lag Metrics**: Baptisms, Groups...
Lag metrics is the section that God is responsible for.

Disciple.Tools - Survey Collection is intended to help with the collection and presentation of regular activity statistics.

## Purpose

This tool helps ministries collect and present the activity of their team members. Knowing that:
- What you measure is what people focus on. What people focus on are the things that grow.
- Regular collection from the field gives better data and trends than sporadic and infrequent collection.
- Some goals are within our control (lead) and some are only accomplished when the Spirit moves - it’s good to know the difference and focus effort in the area of control (raising the sails for when the Spirit blows).

## Usage

#### Will Do

- Gives each team member their own form to report their activity.
- Automatically send each team member a link to their form every week (or every x days). 
- See a summary of each member’s activity.
- Give each member a summary of their activity on their dashboard.
- Work and celebrate together with the combined metrics summary on the the global dashboard 

#### Will Not Do

- Presentation of team based statistics.
- Auto fetching of report statistics from remote Disciple.Tools instances.
